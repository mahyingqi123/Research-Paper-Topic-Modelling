# Research-Paper-Topic-Modelling

This repository contains a framework that leverages embeddings and topic modelling to perform exploratory analysis of research trends. By simply inputting a list of research article information (including title, abstract, and author), users can perform an initial trend analysis of a research area.

## Overview

The framework demonstrates two primary methods for topic modelling:

1. **Traditional LDA Topic Modelling:**  
   Uses the well-established Latent Dirichlet Allocation method to identify topics based on word distributions in research texts.

2. **Embedding-Enhanced Topic Modelling:**  
   Integrates modern embeddings (e.g., BERT, word2vec) into the topic modelling process, enhancing the semantic richness and interpretability of the derived topics.
